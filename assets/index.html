        <h1>Tutorial: Performant and Secure Applications on the Internet Computer</h1>
        <h2>2022, March 1 @ <a href="https://asplos-conference.org/">ASPLOS</a>, Lausanne, Switzerland</h2>


        <p>
          In May 2021 the Internet Computer, a web-speed smart contract and app
          platform, went live. After less than 6 months, the internet computer
          hosts more than 12'000 smart contract apps and serves more than
          100’000 users, providing a plethora of services, ranging from social
          media and chat applications to DeFi and NFTs. Thanks to its
          architecture and support for new service and business models, the
          internet computer has the potential to change how we develop, host and
          use apps.

          In this tutorial we host sessions on developing apps that offer
          enhanced security on this decentralized platform, how such smart
          contracts are executed securely in a sandboxed environmentand how
          trust can be increased further with reproducible builds.

          Trustless Web Applications on the Internet Computer (1h)
        </h2>
        <strong>Speaker: Kyle Peacock</strong>

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> This tutorial will show how the DFINITY
          Foundation’s research can be practically applied to power a fully
          decentralized application development stack, colloquially known as Web
          3.0. Come learn how you can write an app thats offers enhanced
          security on a decentralized and trustless network, while maintaining
          performant reads and writes for users
        </p>

        <p>This demonstration will cover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serving web content on a Certified Asset smart contract</li>
          <li>
            Anonymous authentication without usernames or passwords, using
            Internet Identity
          </li>
          <li>Access control strategies for anonymous users</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Bio:</strong> Kyle has taken on the role of team lead for the
          SDK team, within a year of joining DFINITY as a frontend engineer.
          Kyle takes pride in his ability to break down complex topics and to
          explain them in an intuitive and conversational manner. His passion is
          for user-centered application design, particularly when it comes to
          accessibility.

        <h2 id="helge-bahmann">Smart contract sandboxing (2h)</h2>
        Speaker: Helge Bahmann

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart contract code execution is confined by
          the WebAssembly runtime. The constraints of the runtime are enforced
          by a) limiting access through the system API and b) correctness of the
          JIT-compiled native code derived from the WebAssembly code. The full
          implementation correctness cannot necessarily be fully assumed due to
          the complexity of the components. Additionally, even with a perfectly
          correctly operating JIT compiler, the generated native code executes
          in the context of its host process. This makes it indistinguishable
          from all other code executing in the same process to the CPU. As a
          consequence, the CPU fundamentally cannot be stopped from performing
          speculative access to any memory reachable to the host process. This
          can be abused by completely legitimate WebAssembly code to trigger
          such speculative access. Timing measurements against code execution
          paths may then reveal secrets.
        </p>

        <p>The tutorial will cover the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>IC and WebAssembly</strong> How the IC executes canisters
            and Wasm, how it manages state, memory access tracking and cycles
            accounting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WebAssembly security model</strong>: A detailed look at the
            Wasm security model and how access restrictions are enforced on the
            natively compiled code. Conditions for maintaining the security
            model are discussed, as are some breaches that allow bypassing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Side channel attacks and threat model:</strong> How side
            channel attacks can be mounted through Wasm code and what data could
            be accessed, conditions for a successful attack. The IC needs to
            protect against malicious Wasm code, this will discuss what an
            attacker could (want to) accomplish and how to counter these
            threads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Process separation:</strong> Changing an existing in-process
            execution design to allow out-of-process execution is a major
            software engineering feat, and hence encountered in many projects.
            This will look at issues encountered, how to design for sandboxing &
            strategies for transition and how to organize IPC, how safe sharing
            of bulk data via shared memory can be accomplished and possible
            pitfalls that may violate trust assumptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enforcing process isolation:</strong> How to ensure that the
            different processes cannot interfere with each other. This discusses
            different techniques available for sandboxing processes, from system
            call filtering to mandatory access control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hardening:</strong> To defeat real-world attacks it helps to
            make an attacker's life difficult with various mechanisms: Enforcing
            W^X and design implications of separate compilation, controlled
            process lifecycles and denial of communication channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance considerations:</strong> Sandboxing may affect
            performance but this can be minimized through careful design. Design
            constraints in optimizing for performance will be discussed, how to
            bring performance to parity with in-process execution or even
            surpass it.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Reproducible Builds or “What Code is this Smart Contract Running?”
          (1h)
        </h2>
        Speaker: Ognjen Maric

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Computer programs are usually written in a
          high-level language, but then compiled to a lower-level language in
          order to be executed. Software auditors generally look at the
          high-level source code. This leaves a gap: there is generally no
          guarantee that the deployed (compiled) artifact is really the result
          of compiling the audited source code, and thus no guarantee that the
          audit results apply to the deployed artifact. Reproducible builds fill
          this gap: they allow any third party with access to the source code to
          verify that a provided artifact really results from compiling the
          source. Reproducible builds are especially important in the context of
          decentralized finance, where users transfer the control of their
          digital assets to a smart contract, and have to trust that the smart
          contract will operate according to the claims made by its authors and
          auditors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this tutorial, we will examine the landscape of reproducible build
          tools for the official supported languages on the Internet Computer:
          Motoko, Rust, and Javascript. We will also cover other, more general
          tools useful for reproducible builds, such as Docker and Nix.
